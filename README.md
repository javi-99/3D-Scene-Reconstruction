## Structure-from-Motion
Structure-from-Motion (SfM) is the process of reconstructing 3D structure from its projections into a series of images. The input is a set of overlapping images of the same object, taken from different viewpoints. The output is a 3D reconstruction of the object, and the reconstructed intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters of all images. Typically, Structure-from-Motion systems divide this process into three stages:
   1. Feature detection and extraction
   2. Feature matching and geometric verification
   3. Structure and motion reconstruction
